When I want to launch the simulation by the command python tester.py the simulation didn't occurs and reapeat the same line  : [1295866.000000] [ker_engine/INFO] 2836 actors are still running, waiting for something.
+ Jean Francois said to me :
  + the simulation must start at 0 but in our case the simulation start at 1295866 so it's strange, the cause can be an error in  the end of the simulation. May be the problem can occurs durring the cloture of the simulation.

** Meeting with Danilo
*** Sucessing to run the simulation
Danilo send to me the file simgrid.nix which allow me to configure my nix-env withe the right version of simgrid by the command
#+begin_example
nix-shell simgrid.nix
#+end_example
Now I don't need to run initialize.py, i only need to call make in the directories src/tester and src/simulator
*** Genetique algorithm
To increase the precision and the speed of the computation of the targets given to the regressor for his learning, Danilo have implement a genetic algorithm which compute the best permutation of the set of jobs Q, the metric used to compare the permutation during the genetic algo is the AVGBoundedSlowdown.
**** DONE :: read the paper on the genetic algorithm (https://webmail.etu.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/service/home/~/?auth=co&loc=fr&id=29065&part=2)
+ GA approche to solve RCPSP
**** DONE :: fork the branch https://github.com/fredgrub/scheduling-simulator/tree/dcsantos/genetic_algorithm_dataset_creation into my repositoty
**** DONE :: Implement the method save_score_distribution
***** DONE :: Compute the score of each jobs in the permutation find at the end of genetic algo by the method (rankof the jobs)/(number total of jobs in Q)
***** DONE :: Write the score associate to each jobs on the trainnig data file
**** DONE :: Find a way to define a stop criterion for the number of iteration of the genetic algorithm
* mercredi 14 février
** Preparation magisterial presentation
*** DONE :: The online job scheduling problem can be defined as an NP complete problem?
*** DONE :: Which option is better between talk more about simgrid or talk more about our implementation of the scheduling simulator?
*** DONE :: In the multiple linear regression model the family of functions represent in our case the set of function Lin, Qdr, Cub, Qua ...? And at the end we choose the one which have the best performance?
*** DONE :: Do we loose in explainabilty by using polynomiale features?
*** DONE :: In our simulation how many cores do we have?
*** DONE :: Do we use the same data in trainnig of the models and in the tester.c implementation?
*** DONE :: Data used come from real HPC plateform trace?
*** DONE :: How to define the average bounded slowdown with simple terms ?
